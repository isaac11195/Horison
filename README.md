# Horison

This respository was clone through Github.

The application work excellent. When do you click "Search Engine Optimization" will send you to the part of "search engine optimization". Same happen when you click "Online Reputation Management" will send you to the part of "Online Reputation Management". And if you click "Social Media Marketing" will send you to the part of "Social Media Marketing".

In the CSS and HTML I modify the word Horiseon to see each letter same color and same way. And I change the part if I click Search Engine Optimization you can go to the part of Seach Engine Optimization.

The part that I having problem is if I reduce the size of the page the paragraph can change of the first two ones.
